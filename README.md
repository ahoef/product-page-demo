This is a demo product listing and mini-cart page that uses a global state object to store data returned from a mock service. It uses Nunjucks templates to dynamically generate markup, Sass to pre-process CSS, Json-server to mimic a backend API response, Babel and Browserify to transpile and bundle ES6, and Gulp to manage build tasks.

Requirements:
-Global installation of the Sass gem
-Global installation of the gulp(> version 3.8) and json-server node modules

Local setup:
-From the project folder, run `npm install`
-Run `gulp`
-Head to http://localhost:8080/
